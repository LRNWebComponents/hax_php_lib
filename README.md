# HAX PHP Library
This is a series of helpers for integrating HAX with PHP based systems. Specifically, this helps in getting the HAX Appstore specification output. Appstore is a JSON blob which expresses to HAX how to connect to various services. This helps with integrating with PHP based backends so they can serve up API keys as well as extend what comes across.

You can see this library implemented with some additional customizations in the following frameworks:
- GravCMS - https://github.com/elmsln/grav-plugin-hax/blob/master/hax.php#L79-L91
- Drupal 6 - https://cgit.drupalcode.org/hax/tree/hax.module?h=6.x-2.x#n193
- Drupal 7 - https://cgit.drupalcode.org/hax/tree/hax.module?h=7.x-2.x#n292
- Backdrop - https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/hax/blob/1.x-2.x/hax.module#L221-L236
